**yanp.sh**

Yet Another Nessus Parser.

It will take every Nessus CSV report found in the current working directory and it will parse out the following information from each CSV report:

- List of found IP addresses
- List of resolved hostnames and corresponding IP addresses
- List of open TCP and UDP ports
- List of URLs (http and https)
- List of vulnerabilities and for every vulnerability:
  - List of affected IP addresses
  - List of CVEs

In the end it will also consolidate everything and produce results from all the Nessus reports.

```
# Usage:
cd /directory/with/nessus/results
yanp.sh
```

**portsweep.ps1**

A simple port sweeper, which scans list of hosts for an open port.

It retains results in a file in the current working directory, so it can be interrupted and resumed (it will not scan already scanned hosts again).

```
Import-Module .\portsweep.ps1

# Usage:
portsweep <list.txt> <port>

# Example:
portsweep ips.txt 445

# Check results (find open ports):
gc portsweep.*.txt | select-string True
```
